{"name":"Twitterist","tagline":"Machine Learning powered analysis of your Tweets","body":"## Still working on it\r\n\r\n...but we are building something totally awsome for you. Revisit us at any time or in spring 2016 to get more info.\r\n\r\nFrank & Marco\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\n### 09/08/2015 - Abstract Submission\r\n\r\nRecently, we have submitted our idea to the school officials and already got feedback... They like the idea and we only have some tiny things to optimize in the abstract. Looks like we'll be ready to start coding shorty. \r\nBTW: The project has now also its own Twitter account: [@tw1tterist](https://twitter.com/tw1tterist). Foolow us to keep updated (if you want).\r\n\r\n### 09/02/2015 - Project Idea and Preparation\r\n\r\nEverything has begun with an idea. An idea for the so called \"VDA\" diploma assessment project at the [HF Uster](http://www.hfu.ch) in Switzerland where we (Marco & Frank) are studying. Today, we have concretized our idea and are working on the specification draft to submit it for review. We will probably have a dicision from school in the end of September. If the specification is accepted, we can start coding and give you some more insights. \r\n\r\nAlso, we reserved the domain [twitterist.org](http://twitterist.org) which is the official project homepage. We use this page to keep everyone on track and report about our progress. For the coding geeks: Once we started over, you will find some Scala and Java spice on [github.com/twitterist](https://github.com/twitterist).\r\n\r\nBut hey, for now it's just an idea... Stay tuned.\r\n\r\n## Final Notes\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nAll sourcecode is licensed under [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n\r\nAll Text, Images and Content is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Generic](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/) (unless otherwise stated).","google":"UA-36036584-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
