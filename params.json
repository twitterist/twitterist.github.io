Revisit us at any time or in spring 2016 to get more info.\r\n\r\nFrank & Marco\r\n\r\n# Updates\r\n\r\n### 09/02/2015 - Project Idea and Preparation\r\n\r\nEverything has begun with an idea. An idea for the so called \"VDA\" diploma assessment project at the [HF Uster](http://www.hfu.ch) in Switzerland where we (Marco & Frank) are studying. Today, we have concretized our idea and are working on the specification draft to submit it for review. We will probably have a dicision from school in the end of September. If the specification is accepted, we can start coding and give you some more insights. \r\n\r\nAlso, we reserved the domain [twitterist.org](http://twitterist.org) which is the official project homepage. We use this page to keep everyone on track and report about our progress. For the coding geeks: Once we started over, you will find some Scala and Java spice on [github.com/twitterist](https://github.com/twitterist).\r\n\r\nBut hey, for now it's just an idea... Stay tuned.","google":"UA-36036584-5","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
